Hello,

Someone at busywith.com (<%= @membership.invitor.full_name %>) wants you to be in their team!
Seriously, how loved do you feel?!

You can sign up to busywith.com by clicking here <%= link_to "Sign up!", new_user_url(:email => @membership.target_email) %>.
Make sure you use this email address when you sign up to keep your invite to the team!

If you're not sure what this is and you think you may have got this in error, don't worry.
Just ignore this email and we'll never contact you again, promise!

On the other hand, this could be the start of something wonderful!
