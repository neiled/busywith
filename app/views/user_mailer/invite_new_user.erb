Hello,

Someone at busywith.com (<%= @membership.invitor.full_name %>) wants you to be in their team!
Seriously, how loved do you feel?!

You can sign up to busywith.com by clicking here <%= link_to "Sign up!", new_user_url, :email => @user.email %>.

If you're not sure what this is and you think you may have gotten this in error, don't worry.
Just ignore this email and we'll never contact you again, promise!

On the other hand, this could be the start of something wonderful!
