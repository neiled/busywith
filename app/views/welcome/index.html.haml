          %h2 Keep Track
          %p
            If your team is scattered across all four corners of the globe, hidden in their cubicles or even if you're all
            working out of your mother's basement then busywith will help you keep track of what everyone is working on.
        %li{:id=>"welcome_feature2"}
          %h2 One Screen is all you need
          %p
            Bookmark your team's screen and just have it running in the background, busywith updates it automatically so
            you know every time you look at it that it's up to date!
        %li{:id=>"welcome_feature3"}
          %h2 Quick and Easy
          %p
            Each member of the team only has to update a few fields each time they change task. Updates take seconds with no
            long forms to fill-in. It's quick, simple and easy to update which means it gets used more, but it still has a
            lot of useful information to help you plan the next stages of the project.
        %li{:id=>"welcome_feature4"}
          %h2 Simple, but effective
          %p
            Twitter, IM and Email all have their place, we love them! But sometimes you just want to be able to
            see at a glance what everyone is doing, this is where busywith can help. Give it a try.
