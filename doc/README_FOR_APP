I'm Busy With

Worker:
Describe current task on current project with estimated amount complete and estimated completion date. All parts are optional. Can subscribe to other workers' details.

Subscriber:
Can see project/task/progress information of workers that they subscribe to.

* Allow ordering of subscriptions.
